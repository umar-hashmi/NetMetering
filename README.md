## Introduction
We formulate the optimal control problem for an end user energy storage device in
presence of net metering. We propose a computationally efficient algorithm, with worst case run time complexity of O(N^2), that computes the optimal energy ramping rates in a time horizon. The proposed algorithm exploits the problemâ€™s piecewise linear structure and convexity properties for the discretization of optimal Lagrange multipliers. The solution has a threshold-based structure in which optimal control decisions are independent of past or
future price as well as of net load values beyond a certain time horizon, defined as a sub-horizon. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm.

In this formulation we consider: (a) net-metering compensation (with selling price at best equal to buying price) i.e. $\kappa_i \in [0,1]$, (b) inelastic load, (c) consumer renewable generation, (d) storage charging and discharging losses, (e) storage ramping constraint and (f) storage capacity constraint.
